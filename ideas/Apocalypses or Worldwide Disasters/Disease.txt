A mutation in bacteria leads to a new sexually transmitted  disease. As the disease progresses, the victim becomes more attractive,  charming and amorous, until they finally die a horrendously painful  death.

Astronauts returning to earth bring back a strange alien  disease. The only symptom is ever-increasing euphoria, eventually  leaving the victim so happy and content that they no longer feel any  need to go to work, bathe, eat…

Scientists engineer a virus  that dramatically increases human intelligence. Unfortunately, there is a  side effect: obsessive paranoia. As people lose trust in each other,  society begins to crumble.

A man named Gary comes down with a  bad cold. In his job at a nuclear power plant, he is exposed to a strong  dose of radiation which mutates the virus. Instead of injecting its own  DNA into human cells, the cold virus injects copies of Gary’s DNA.  Anyone who catches Gary’s cold is slowly transformed into his clone. The  planet soon has an epidemic of Garyitis.
