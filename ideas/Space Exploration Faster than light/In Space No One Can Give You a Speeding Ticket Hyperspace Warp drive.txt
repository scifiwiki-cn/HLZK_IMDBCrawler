A scientist discovers hyperspace, a new kind of space where ordinary  laws of physics are changed. In hyperspace, spaceships can travel  faster than light. But the astronauts start to see strange beings  outside their windows, and what looks suspiciously like souls in  torment. Is hyperspace… hell?

Variation – Astronauts experimenting with newly-discovered  hyperspace technology find that they can reach not just other planets,  but also the afterlife. They can visit their dead friends and relatives.  What happens when the astronauts try to bring someone back?

Astronauts discover that traveling through hyperspace has strange  effects on the human body. Namely, it is the universe’s most powerful  aphrodisiac.

Due to an oddity of physics, every trip through hyperspace causes the astronauts to lose IQ points.

In hyperspace, the ships can travel faster than the speed of light.  However, traveling outside of normal spacetime has its risks. People age  and grow younger, transform into strange creatures, or vanish, to  reappear anywhere in the universe.

Colonists traveling through hyperspace end up in a parallel universe, where they face alternate versions of themselves.

The janitor at a scientific research company steals a prototype hyperdrive and installs it in his pickup truck.

A multi-planet corporation sponsors a faster-than-light race across  the stars. After one man’s father dies in the race, he vows to come back  next year and destroy the race forever… with a black hole.

The government tests a spacecraft equipped with a prototype warp  drive, a device capable of bending time and space. Unfortunately, using  the device creates space/time anomalies on the earth below: areas where  time travels faster or slower than normal, areas where time travels in  reverse, temporary portals to the other side of the universe, and even  greater dangers.
